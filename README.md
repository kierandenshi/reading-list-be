# Reading List API
Hello! Thank you for your interest in joining our back end engineering team at Stylindex :)

We ask all candidates to complete this short exercise to help us evaluate their suitability for the roles we are recruiting for. We recommend spending between 2 and 4 hours. You will have an opportunity to discuss your solution, and the choices you made at the next interview stage.

## The Exercise
Create a simple, 2 endpoint JSON api that fetches data from an external source. 

### Acceptance Criteria
* Fetch data from `https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/styl-reading-list/data.json`
* Endpoint `/books` should return a collection of books
* Endpoint `/books` should be capable of returning data sorted by publication date, ascending and descending
* Endpoint `/books` should be capable of returning data sorted alphabetically by title, ascending and descending
* Endpoint `/authors` should return a collection of authors, each author item should contain a collection of their books

### Requirements
A good solution will
* satisfy the acceptance criteria
* have good test coverage
* use _appropriate_ libraries
* be production ready

Please put your solution on a repository hosting service such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and don't forget to include a README file to tell us how to build and run the application :)
